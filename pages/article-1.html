          It's often said that depression results from a chemical imbalance, but that figure of speech doesn't capture
          how
          complex the disease is. Research suggests that depression doesn't spring from simply having too much or too
          little
          of certain brain chemicals. Rather, there are many possible causes of depression, including faulty mood
          regulation
          by the brain, genetic vulnerability, stressful life events, medications, and medical problems. It's believed
          that
          several of these forces interact to bring on depression.
        </p>

        <p>
          To be sure, chemicals are involved in this process, but it is not a simple matter of one chemical being too
          low
          and
          another too high. Rather, many chemicals are involved, working both inside and outside nerve cells. There are
          millions, even billions, of chemical reactions that make up the dynamic system that is responsible for your
          mood,
          perceptions, and how you experience life.
        </p>

        <p>
          With this level of complexity, you can see how two people might have similar symptoms of depression, but the
          problem
          on the inside, and therefore what treatments will work best, may be entirely different.
        </p>
        <p>
          Researchers have learned much about the biology of depression. They've identified genes that make individuals
          more
          vulnerable to low moods and influence how an individual responds to drug therapy. One day, these discoveries
          should
          lead to better, more individualized treatment (see "From the lab to your medicine cabinet"), but that is
          likely
          to
          be years away. And while researchers know more now than ever before about how the brain regulates mood, their
          understanding of the biology of depression is far from complete.
        </p>

        <p>
          What follows is an overview of the current understanding of the major factors believed to play a role in the
          causes
          of depression.
        </p>

        <h2>The brain's impact on depression</h2>
        <p>
          Popular lore has it that emotions reside in the heart. Science, though, tracks the seat of your emotions to
          the
          brain. Certain areas of the brain help regulate mood. Researchers believe that — more important than levels of
          specific brain chemicals — nerve cell connections, nerve cell growth, and the functioning of nerve circuits
          have
          a
          major impact on depression. Still, their understanding of the neurological underpinnings of mood is
          incomplete.
        </p>
        <h2>Regions that affect mood</h2>
        <p>
          Increasingly sophisticated forms of brain imaging — such as positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon
          emission computed tomography (SPECT), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) — permit a much closer
          look at the working brain than was possible in the past. An fMRI scan, for example, can track changes that
          take
          place when a region of the brain responds during various tasks. A PET or SPECT scan can map the brain by
          measuring the distribution and density of neurotransmitter receptors in certain areas.
        </p>

        <p>
          Use of this technology has led to a better understanding of which brain regions regulate mood and how other
          functions, such as memory, may be affected by depression. Areas that play a significant role in depression are
          the amygdala, the thalamus, and the hippocampus (see Figure 1).
        </p>

        <p>
          Research shows that the hippocampus is smaller in some depressed people. For example, in one fMRI study
          published in The Journal of Neuroscience, investigators studied 24 women who had a history of depression. On
          average, the hippocampus was 9% to 13% smaller in depressed women compared with those who were not depressed.
          The more bouts of depression a woman had, the smaller the hippocampus. Stress, which plays a role in
          depression,
          may be a key factor here, since experts believe stress can suppress the production of new neurons (nerve
          cells)
          in the hippocampus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Researchers are exploring possible links between sluggish production of new neurons in the hippocampus and low
          moods. An interesting fact about antidepressants supports this theory. These medications immediately boost the
          concentration of chemical messengers in the brain (neurotransmitters). Yet people typically don't begin to
          feel
          better for several weeks or longer. Experts have long wondered why, if depression were primarily the result of
          low levels of neurotransmitters, people don't feel better as soon as levels of neurotransmitters increase.
        </p>

        <p>
          The answer may be that mood only improves as nerves grow and form new connections, a process that takes weeks.
          In fact, animal studies have shown that antidepressants do spur the growth and enhanced branching of nerve
          cells
          in the hippocampus. So, the theory holds, the real value of these medications may be in generating new neurons
          (a process called neurogenesis), strengthening nerve cell connections, and improving the exchange of
          information
          between nerve circuits. If that's the case, depression medications could be developed that specifically
          promote
          neurogenesis, with the hope that patients would see quicker results than with current treatments.
