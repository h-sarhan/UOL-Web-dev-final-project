        <h2>Exercise is as effective as drugs in some cases.</h2>
        <p>One in 10 adults in the United States struggles with depression, and antidepressant medications are a common
          way to treat the condition. However, pills aren't the only solution. Research shows that exercise is also an
          effective treatment. "For some people it works as well as antidepressants, although exercise alone isn't
          enough for someone with severe depression," says Dr. -Michael Craig Miller, assistant professor of psychiatry
          at Harvard Medical School.</p>
        <h2>The exercise effect</h2>
        <p>Exercising starts a biological cascade of events that results in many health benefits, such as protecting
          against heart disease and diabetes, improving sleep, and lowering blood pressure. High-intensity exercise
          releases the body's feel-good chemicals called endorphins, resulting in the "runner's high" that joggers
          report. But for most of us, the real value is in low-intensity exercise sustained over time. That kind of
          activity spurs the release of proteins called neurotrophic or growth factors, which cause nerve cells to grow
          and make new connections. The improvement in brain function makes you feel better. "In people who are
          depressed, neuroscientists have noticed that the hippocampus in the brain—the region that helps regulate
          mood—is smaller. Exercise supports nerve cell growth in the hippocampus, improving nerve cell connections,
          which helps relieve depression," explains Dr. Miller.</p>
        <h2>The challenge of getting started</h2>
        <p>Depression manifests physically by causing disturbed sleep, reduced energy, appetite changes, body aches, and
          increased pain perception, all of which can result in less motivation to exercise. It's a hard cycle to break,
          but Dr. Miller says getting up and moving just a little bit will help. "Start with five minutes a day of
          walking or any activity you enjoy. Soon, five minutes of activity will become 10, and 10 will become 15."</p>
        <h2>What you can do</h2>
        <p>It's unclear how long you need to exercise, or how intensely, before nerve cell improvement begins
          alleviating depression symptoms. You should begin to feel better a few weeks after you begin exercising. But
          this is a long-term treatment, not a onetime fix. "Pick something you can sustain over time," advises Dr.
          Miller. "The key is to make it something you like and something that you'll want to keep doing."</p>
