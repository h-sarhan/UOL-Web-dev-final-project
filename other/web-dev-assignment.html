<div id="" class="rc-CML styled" dir="auto"><div><h2>Large Coursework Brief</h2><p>Your brief is to <strong>design and build a responsive website</strong> of a magazine or a newsletter. This may take the form of a topical or a news magazine or a newsletter for a club or society. If possible this should represent a real situation. For example:</p><p>• A topical magazine should be of interest to people who follow that topic, so find a group of enthusiasts about a topic that would like a magazine.</p><p>• Find a club that needs a newsletter and try to understand what that might cover and look like.</p><p>Be careful ... make it clear that you are interested to prototype a web site for a student project, and perhaps later show them what might be possible. Don’t promise to build them a web site for this assignment. If you want to negotiate to do that in your own time as an individual feel free to do that.</p><p>Your web site should have 5 pages with different types of news and articles. Wherever possible sample content should be representative of the material for that web site. It should have appropriate media, including video and sound clips if relevant. </p><p>In addition to the web site, you will include a<strong> report.html</strong> file with associated images etc. in your site's base directory. This will explain what you have learned in the process of building your site, where you found your information, and how you have adapted any resources (if applicable). The outline template for the report can be found here:</p><div data-id="7g_1ehXDEemP8Qpm209XvA" data-url="https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/7g_1ehXDEemP8Qpm209XvA_ee527c6015c311e99f661b30930906ff_web_dev_report_spec.pdf?Expires=1579910400&amp;Signature=Pvcbq9SU-gNlU1Hr3EmYDUHATPrpnBx3IUGyL8o3wNDmW-32fbr-q65U-gDb0L1aQpvBygG8chNxekTOlmLUqSTkzf9gQzCt0ydvgv4X~uC1a13O7puGC~zUGcpwyhxggsY5whP7kgssnc0xIBn9sy0BCgeMsK5t1D3DVlIKKjI_&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A" data-name="web_dev_report_spec" data-type="pdf" data-extension="pdf" class="cml-asset cml-asset-pdf" role="link"><div class="asset-container horizontal-box"><div class="asset-info horizontal-box align-items-vertical-center"><svg class="SvgIcon_8wfvj4" style="fill:#888888;height:24px;width:24px;" viewBox="0 0 48 48" role="img" aria-labelledby="Filedefault FiledefaultDesc" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title id="Filedefault">File</title><path d="M0,48 L0,0 L36,0 L36,48 L0,48 Z M2,46 L34,46 L34,2 L2,2 L2,46 Z" role="presentation"></path><polygon points="10 16 26 16 26 14 10 14" role="presentation"></polygon><polygon points="10 24 26 24 26 22 10 22" role="presentation"></polygon><polygon points="10 32 22 32 22 30 10 30" role="presentation"></polygon></svg><span class="asset-info vertical-box"><span class="asset-name">web_dev_report_spec.pdf</span><span class="asset-extension font-xs">PDF File</span></span></div><a href="https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/7g_1ehXDEemP8Qpm209XvA_ee527c6015c311e99f661b30930906ff_web_dev_report_spec.pdf?Expires=1579910400&amp;Signature=Pvcbq9SU-gNlU1Hr3EmYDUHATPrpnBx3IUGyL8o3wNDmW-32fbr-q65U-gDb0L1aQpvBygG8chNxekTOlmLUqSTkzf9gQzCt0ydvgv4X~uC1a13O7puGC~zUGcpwyhxggsY5whP7kgssnc0xIBn9sy0BCgeMsK5t1D3DVlIKKjI_&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg class="SvgIcon_8wfvj4" style="fill:#2A73CC;height:24px;width:24px;" viewBox="0 0 48 48" role="img" aria-labelledby="ExternalLinkdefault ExternalLinkdefaultDesc" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title id="ExternalLinkdefault">External Link</title><polygon points="25.0002 0.0004 25.0002 2.0004 36.5862 2.0004 14.2932 24.2934 15.7072 25.7074 38.0002 3.4144 38.0002 14.9994 39.9992 14.9994 39.9992 0.0004" role="presentation"></polygon><polygon points="0 4 0 40 36 40 36 22 34 22 34 38 2 38 2 6 18 6 18 4" role="presentation"></polygon></svg></a></div></div><p>The specific items you should include in the report are shown in the report template and listed in the Design and Reflection review criteria. </p></div></div>
